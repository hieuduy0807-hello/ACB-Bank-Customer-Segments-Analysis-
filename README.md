  Married: The majority of attracted clients are married, comprising approximately 60.52% of the total. This indicates that the campaigns are particularly effective in reaching individuals within this marital status category.

  Single: Single clients represent around 28.09% of the attracted clientele. This shows a significant portion of the target audience includes individuals who are not currently married.
	
 Campaign Engagement:
    
  On average, it requires 2 calls to successfully attract a client, with an average of 2.05 calls per client. This metric highlights the engagement level required to convert prospects into customers.
    
  The average call duration for attracting clients is 9 minutes and 13 seconds. This suggests that a substantial amount of time is invested in each call to achieve successful client acquisition.
    
  The “student” category exhibits the longest average call duration at approximately 283.68 seconds (4 minutes and 43.68 seconds). This extended duration suggests that engaging students requires more in-depth discussions or more time to address their specific needs. 
  
  The “technician” category shows the shortest average call duration at approximately 250.23 seconds (4 minutes and 10.23 seconds). This shorter duration indicates that interactions with technicians may be more streamlined or require less detailed communication.
	
 Additional Client Age Insight:

# Recommendations 

Given that 60.52% of attracted clients are married, develop marketing campaigns that focus on family-oriented financial products, such as joint accounts, family insurance plans, and savings for children’s education.

Married and Retired Clients: Given the higher engagement levels in these groups, consider offering personalized follow-up services and loyalty programs to strengthen relationships and increase retention.

For categories like “students” who have the longest average call duration (283.68 seconds), streamline the communication process to make it more efficient while still addressing their needs. Consider developing concise, engaging scripts or FAQs that address common queries.

Develop retirement-focused financial products for older clients and investment opportunities for younger clients.
